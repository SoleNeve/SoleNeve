# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Valentino Spirito
**Digital Craftsman (Developer/Student/Creator)**

Hi, I'm Valentino Spirito, a computer science student passionate about technology and problem-solving. I love finding solutions to challenges that have a positive impact on the real world, and I aim to achieve that through software development.

Currently, I'm building my skills in frontend development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have a decent grasp of Python and enjoy exploring its potential. I'm particularly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and I'm excited to dive deeper into these fields. Although I haven't worked on any significant projects yet, I'm eager to learn, grow, and take on new opportunities.

Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentino-spirito-353867329" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrlHHn4fnUSP5r5g22HFhnQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a> for updates on my journey!
