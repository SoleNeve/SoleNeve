# 👨🏻‍💻 Valentino Spirito
**Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)**

Hi, I'm Valentino Spirito, a computer science student passionate about technology and problem-solving. I love finding solutions to challenges that have a positive impact on the real world, and I aim to achieve that through software development.

Currently, I'm building my skills in frontend development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have a decent grasp of Python and enjoy exploring its potential. I'm particularly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and I'm excited to dive deeper into these fields. Although I haven't worked on any significant projects yet, I'm eager to learn, grow, and take on new opportunities.

Feel free to connect with me on <a href=linkedin.com/in/valentino-spirito-353867329>LinkedIn</a> or check out my YouTube channel for updates on my journey!
